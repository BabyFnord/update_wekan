# update_wekan

[WeKan](https://wekan.github.io) is an open-source kanban board. This script automates updating a bundle-based WeKan instance hosted on Uberspace 7. To install WeKan in the first place, see [this guide](https://lab.uberspace.de/guide_wekan.html).

NOTA BENE
This project has moved to https://codeberg.org/BabyFn0rd/update_wekan for obvious reasons.
